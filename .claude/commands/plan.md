Read GitHub Issue #$ARGUMENTS and produce a structured implementation plan.

## Instructions

1. Fetch the issue using `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,labels`
2. Parse the issue fields: acceptance_criteria, security_considerations, trust_boundaries_affected, input_output_contracts, testability_criteria, threat_surface
3. **STOP and refuse to proceed if the threat_surface field is empty or missing.** Report: "Cannot plan — threat_surface is required but empty in issue #$ARGUMENTS. Update the issue before proceeding."

## Output Format

### Scope
